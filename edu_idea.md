# EDU IDEA - AI-Powered Task Management App

**Date Created:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** Concept Phase

---

## THE VISION

Build an app that uses AI (free models like Hugging Face) to help users manage their assignments and tasks through natural language commands.

## CORE CONCEPT

**NOT complex AI tasks** - Simple, practical AI integration:
- AI answers questions about user's data ("how many assignments left?")
- AI performs simple navigation ("open settings", "show assignments")
- AI uses IN-APP data (assignments, due dates, user tiers, etc.)
- Free AI model integration (Hugging Face or similar)

## HOW IT WORKS

**User Experience:**
```
User: "How many assignments am I left on?"
AI: "You have 12 assignments remaining across 3 courses"

User: "What's due tomorrow?"
AI: "You have 3 assignments due tomorrow: Math homework, English essay, History project"

User: "Open accounts and settings"
AI: *navigates to settings page*
```

**Technical Approach:**
1. User inputs their assignments/tasks/due dates into app
2. AI processes natural language commands
3. AI extracts intent and maps to app functions
4. App queries user's data and responds/performs action
5. Simple, clean interaction - no over-complication

## KEY FEATURES (Potential)

- Add/edit/delete assignments
- Set due dates and priorities
- Track progress (tiers/levels)
- Natural language queries
- Voice or text commands
- AI navigation assistance
- Smart reminders based on due dates

## WHAT NEEDS TO BE DECIDED

1. **Platform:** Web app? Desktop? Mobile? Extension?
2. **Target Users:** Students? General productivity? Specific niche?
3. **Assignment Types:** School? Work? General tasks?
4. **Core Problem:** What pain point are we solving?
5. **MVP Scope:** Minimum features to be useful

## AI INTEGRATION PLAN

**Free AI Options:**
- Hugging Face models (free API)
- Google Gemini (free tier)
- Ollama (local, free)

**AI Role:**
- Natural language understanding (commands â†’ intents)
- Query user's data intelligently
- Simple app navigation
- NOT complex tasks like UI changes or deep decision-making

## WHY THIS WORKS

- AI makes app interaction more natural
- Uses existing free models (no building AI from scratch)
- Solves real problem (managing assignments is tedious)
- Scoped properly (AI does what it's good at, not everything)
- Can help many people, not just one use case

## LESSONS FROM EDGENUITY PROJECT

- Start simple, build what actually works
- Understand the real problem before coding
- Don't over-engineer
- Respect constraints (like we learned with server-side validation)
- Iterate based on real needs, not assumptions

**Next Steps:**
1. Properly design the app (platform, features, scope)
2. Choose AI model/API
3. Build MVP
4. Test with real users
5. Iterate and improve

**Status:** On hold while we figure out proper design and requirements
